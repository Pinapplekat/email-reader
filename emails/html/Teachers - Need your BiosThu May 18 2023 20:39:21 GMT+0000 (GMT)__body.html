"<div dir=\"ltr\">Teachers,<div><br></div><div>I need your bios for the youth sacrament meeting this Sunday.....the deacons and priests are challenging you as my favorite quorum as they have almost all sent theirs in. Please send them over today if possible. Should take you all of 5-10 minutes to write up. If you need some inspiration on what to say:</div><div><ul><li>Tell us your name, age, grade in school</li><li>Hobbies/Sports/interests</li><li>Favorite scripture or scripture story</li><li>Favorite food</li><li>Favorite ice cream flavor</li><li>Some place you would like to visit</li></ul><div>You get the idea....doesn&#39;t need to be longer than a few sentences, gives members of the ward a general idea of who you are and what your interestsÂ are. Thanks guys!</div></div></div>\n"
